# Dr. Seg: Revisiting GRPO Training for Visual Large Language Models through Perception-Oriented Design

> We revisit GRPO training for visual segmentation and detection and propose Dr. Seg, a simple plug-and-play framework featuring a Look-to-Confirm mechanism and a Distribution-Ranked Reward module. It requires no architectural modifications and integrates seamlessly with existing GRPO-based VLLMs. Extensive experiments show that Dr. Seg improves performance in complex visual scenarios while preserving strong generalization.
